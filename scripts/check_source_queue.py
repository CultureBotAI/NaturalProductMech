"""Check curation/source_queue.tsv against the repository it describes.

The queue ranks candidate data sources for the corpus. It is curator-owned prose
in a TSV, so nothing stops it drifting into wishful thinking: a source marked
ADOPTED that the pipeline never reads, a licence left UNVERIFIED under a record
the corpus redistributes, a gap named that the schema does not have.

This checks the claims that are checkable:

  * shape — known columns, known enum values, no duplicate ids
  * every gap named is a real field a record can carry
  * ADOPTED means adopted: the source appears in conf/sources.yaml, its
    redistribution terms have been verified, and it carries a verification date
  * conversely, every source the pipeline actually reads has an ADOPTED row
  * an ADOPTED seed source carries terms the corpus's own licence can pass on.
    This is a tripwire AT ADOPTION, not a ban on candidates: a CANDIDATE row may
    sit at `use: SEED` with UNVERIFIED terms for as long as it takes to check
    them, and nine do. What it stops is adopting one without checking.
    Record content is CC BY 4.0 (see LICENSE-DATA): attribution rides along, and
    downstream users are not further restricted. So share-alike would propagate
    an obligation CC BY does not impose, and NonCommercial would restrict users
    CC BY does not restrict — both are refused for seeding, as are bespoke
    restrictive terms and terms nobody has checked
